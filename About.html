    <h1> About Common Grounds</h1>
    <p> Common Grounds is locally owned by the McCreary <br>family. It started
      in 1992 as just a local coffee shop and <br>has grown into the largest locally
      owned coffee business <br>
      in Lexington. Besides the 3 stores, Common Ground's has<br>a warehouse facility where coffee is roasted fresh every
      <br>week and  the warehouse is where the majority of the<br>
      food products are made in the company's commercial <br>kitchen. The warehouse is also where other local Kentucky
      <br>coffee shop owners come to purchase coffee shop
      <br>products like DaVinci syrups, Gheradelli chocolate and of<br>course freshly roasted coffee.
